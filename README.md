ng-torrent-ui
=============

ng-torrent-ui is born as a replacement for the uTorrent WebUI, focusing on download management and responsiveness instead of covering each and every functionality.
The use of virtual scrolling removes the need for paging even on a hige list (tested with ~7k torrents), also on a mobile device.

It is mainly focused on remote controlling the download list instead of trying to replicate each and every feature of the desktop application.

Development status
=======

### Notes

Current version is developed on Î¼Torrent 2.2.1 (build 25302) with the latest version of Chrome, since it is not working well with the official WebUI and it is still very used in the community (possibly more than the latest version). Newer versions will be supported at a later time.

Project created with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).
